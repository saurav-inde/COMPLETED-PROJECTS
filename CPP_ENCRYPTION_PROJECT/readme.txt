this is simple program to encrpt text files.
I personally use it to store passwords in encrypted form on my pc safe from Password storage softwares.
During encryption extra text files generated are not useful and can be deleted by user.


PROCESS:
1. COMPILE THE main.cpp.
2. run the executable
3. follow the instructions
4. file data will be encrypted

PS:
1. USERKEY YOU CHOOSE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED BY YOU ONLY AND THE PROGRAM DOESN'T STORE ANYTHING FOR YOU OTHER THAN ENCRYPTED TEXT FILE.
2. CHOOSE USERKEY AS PER YOUR CONVINIENCE, IT CAN BE SENTACE WORDS WITH SPACES AND CHARS ETC...
3. DONT USE SPACES IN START AND END OF USERNAME
4. YOU WILL NOT BLAME ANYONE ELSE BUT YOURSELF IF YOU FORGET YOUR KEY.
5. TEXT FILE YOU WANT TO ENCRYPT SHOULD BE IN SAME DIRECTORY AS THE EXECUTABLE.


IMPORTANT:
DON'T ENCRYPT ENRYTED DATA AGAIN. MOST PROBABLY YOU WILL LOOSE THE DATA IN OCEAN OF NUMBERS NOT RETRIEVABLE.
